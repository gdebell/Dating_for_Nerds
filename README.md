### Dating for Nerds is a dating website.  The website allows a user to look through other user's profiles.  A user must be logged in to access the site.  



## Technologies Used:

### Angular, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Materialize
### For this assignment I learned about Angular.  This is only my third application built using Angular.  
### To understand Angular, I became familiar with directives, services, and controllers.  I also learned about how tokens allow or prevent a user to access different parts of a web-site. I also learned about state provider, and partial views.    
### I also became familiar with Materialize to style my site.
